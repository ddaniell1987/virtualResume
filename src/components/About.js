                That was 2 years ago now and I have fallen in love with the craft more than ever. I started
                my career in Healthcare but recently decided to make the switch because I wanted to be challenged and learn something
                new on a rountine basis. I am working to be the best. I love creating, trying to write clean code in the process. Sometimes I fail but I keep going!
